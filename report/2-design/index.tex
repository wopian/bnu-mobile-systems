\chapter{Design}

%You need to develop an App idea, this need not be unique but might be based on an app you currently use or have seen used with a functionality adaptation.  Maybe you will consider a ‘mash-up’ of other ideas you have come across.  The main point here is to consider your idea within a market segment then design, implement, test and publish your app on a mobile device or a mobile device emulator running on a computer.

%You are required to produce a brief report covering the background to the app idea covering the design, implementation, testing and publishing of your App.  The main salient aspects should be discussed e.g. various supporting stages of the development process, problems and how they were overcome, USP (unique selling point) etc. Please remember you need to justify any decisions/choices made in your design/development.
